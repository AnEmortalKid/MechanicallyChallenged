## What is Mechanically challenged?
Mechanically challenged is a monthly challenge in which we and the community
re-create different mechanics found in games! You are free to implement it in
any game engine or however you want, to join, fork this repository and upload
the mechanic! The goal is to create a repository of examples for these mechanics
in as many engines and languages as possible.

Each month a new mechanic will be explained and gifs of the mechanic will be
uploaded.

## April 2024
This months mechanic is... **Dropping through platforms**! 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MooNiZZ/MechanicallyChallenged/main/JumpDownThroughPlatformDeadCells2.gif)

This is a very common mechanic in 2D Platformers, where you can stand on a
platform and hold down and press jump to drop through the platform you're
standing on.

### How to Participate?

1. Create a fork of this repository
2. Within your fork, create a folder that follows the following structure: `{EngineName}/{LanguageName}/{UserName}`

For example, if I were using `Godot 3` using `C#` and my username was `The Captain Coder`, I would create a folder called `Godot3/CSharp/TheCaptainCoder`.

3. Implement your solution within that folder
4. Create a Pull Request with your solution

6. ???
7. Profit!
