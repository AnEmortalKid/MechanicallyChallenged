## What is Mechanically challenged?
Mechanically challenged is a monthly challenge in which we and the community re-create different mechanics found in games!
You are free to implement it in any game engine or however you want, to join, fork this repository and upload the mechanic!

Each month a new mechanic will be explained and gifs of the mechanic will be uploaded.

## April 2024
This months mechanic is... **Dropping through platforms**!

This is a very common mechanic in 2D Platformers, where you can stand on a platform and hold down and press jump to drop through the platform you're standing on.


## Where can I watch this?
Introduction about Mechanically challenged will be held on [TheCaptainCoder's Twitch](https://twitch.tv/theCaptainCoder) on Saturday April 6th at 1PM CEST
